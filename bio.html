           <h3>Overview</h3>
           <p>I'm David Jin, a final year undergraduate computer science student at Northwestern
             University. I am an ambitious individual and critical and analytical thinker.
             To me, nothing feels better than decomposing and logically solving complex problems,
             and I am always reflecting on experiences to learn and identify ways to improve.
             My primary interests lie in networking and systems.<br>

             <br>I was born in Toronto, Canada, where I lived for 12 years before
             moving to Chicago, USA. As a result, I have a great affinity for Canada and the UK.
             In my free time, I enjoy listening to Oasis and other British rock, playing guitar,
             and watching soccer and Formula 1.<br><br>
